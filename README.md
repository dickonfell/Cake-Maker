# Cake-Maker

This is a script written in Python for the game Runescape that makes the player money by taking cakes and chocolate and turning them into chocolate cakes (in the game, the combined product sells for a good deal more than the sum of the values of its parts). I used the pynput module to take control of the mouse for movement and clicking, and wrote an algorithm to mimic the sequence of movements a player would make to convert the ingredients into chocolate cake. Runescape is a point and click game so this method is highly effective. 

This script is somewhat primitive given that the player needs to setup manually before they can make use of it, and will need to sell the finished product by hand as well (perhaps I will include these features in the future if I find time). However, what I have created here will do the bulk of the work for you.
