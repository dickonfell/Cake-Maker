# Cake-Maker

This is a script written in Python for the game Runescape that makes money by taking cakes and chocolate and turning them into chocolate cakes. In the game, the combined product sells for a good deal more than the sum of its parts. It works by using the pynput module to take control of the mouse for movement and clicking, and then I have programmed the sequence of movements a player would make to convert the ingredients into chocolate cake. Runescape is a point and click game so this method is highly effective. It is somewhat primitive, given that the player needs to buy the cake and chocolate before they can make use of this script, and will need to sell the finished product by hand as well (perhaps I will add these features in later if I get bored). However, what I have created here will do the bulk of the work for you.
